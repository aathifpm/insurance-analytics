npm run start-all
```

Or run them separately:

Frontend:
```bash
npm start
```

ML server:
```bash
cd ml_server
python app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

## Development

Note: You'll need to:
1. Create a `screenshots` directory in your project
2. Take screenshots of the key interfaces mentioned
3. Add the screenshots to the directory
4. Update the image paths in the README

The screenshots should showcase:
- The main dashboard with charts and metrics
- The claim submission form
- The claims list view
- The fraud analysis results interface
- The admin panel

Would you like me to provide guidance on taking and optimizing the screenshots?
